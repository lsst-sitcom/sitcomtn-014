\section{Documentation Sources}
\label{sec:primary-sources}

Describe here the proposed location of the documentation sources.  
These are a subset of the identified source listed in SITCOMTN-012.

One major requirement is to have one source of truth for all documentation. 

Need to take information from Storage View subsections, then find gaps to confirm add with DWG or identify potential gaps for project/departments/groups to consider.
