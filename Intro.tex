\section{Introduction}

This document serves as a proposal developed by the Vera C.\ Rubin Observatory Project-wide Documentation Working Group to fulfill the charge defined in \url{LSE-489.lsst.io}.
This proposal includes a systematic structure and methodology to save the different types of documentation that will be released or collected from the different systems of Rubin Observatory,
in order to achieve a reliable source of documentation, separated by system and specialty, as a way to guarantee the users' reliable access to the required information.

As a measure to systematically collect and collate information, four "Documentation~Views" have been developed to
plan an orderly transition from commissioning to the operation,
create an efficient internal structure that bases its approach on the users, staff and communities,
and extend into operations to provide operational expectations with reliability and confidence throughout Rubin Observatory Operations
(lasting impact on science, strong workplace safety and environmentally sustainable culture, integrated and diverse community interaction, etc.).
They are intended to record, classify, categorize, define ownership and target audience, and connect relationships and dependencies.
The Documentation Views are detailed in Section~\ref{sec:views}.

The Documentation Views fuel the proposed "Documentation~Portal," a web application to provide access and discovery of different documents and documentation types
for assisting users with reliable access to the required information and its primary source.
Its architecture utilizes products already implemented for Rubin Observatory operations.
The Documentation Portal is detailed in Section~\ref{sec:DocPortal}.

Examples and diagrams are provided using currently available documentation and information ---
in preparation for this proposal, the project-wide Documentation Working Group inventoried the sources of critical and historical documentation for the Rubin Observatory Construction,
and also included some sources developed by Pre-operations and Operations Teams \citedsp{SITCOMTN-012}.
These examples demonstrate the core concepts proposed and were used by the Documentation Working Group to validate the proposal.
They may be used as an initial starting point or adapted to the specific needs and processes of those served by Rubin Observatory.

The implementation plan includes estimates the effort to transition to the documentation new strategy, including expected effort and resources to achieve the and timeline. A suggested workflow to transition to the proposed documentation state and add new documents.
