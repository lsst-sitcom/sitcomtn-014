\section{Transition and implementation planning in operations}
\label{sec:implementation}

the need of defining the workflow of the documentation and data produced leads to create an official group of determined actions to officially save the operational documentation, classify it, separate it by the specific Department, System, Subsystem, facility, type, and application. 

Add here an overview of the proposed implementation plan including the following specific areas of implementation:

\begin{itemize}

\item Primary Sources
\item Documentation Portal
\item DocuShare
\item PDM Works
\item Resources and Responsibilities
\item Schedule
\item Transition Workflow
\item Special Topics (e.g., Bilingual)

\end{itemize}
