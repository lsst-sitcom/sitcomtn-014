\subsection{Topic View}

The \emph{Topic View} is an approach to categorize information into document types.
Its purpose is to allow users the ability to find information of a specific form within a system.
It first requires a defined decomposition of systems, subsystems and components.
With that information, documentation can be categorized into the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item design documents
\item requirement documents
\item technical manuals (e.g., operation or maintenance)
\item operational documents (e.g., procedures)
\item data performance
\item evaluation processes
\item maintenance reports
\item safety and hazard mitigations
\item access and software
\end{itemize}
